# Managed Remote Operations

## Workflow

Run the complete local demonstration from the repository root:

```sh
uv run python examples/operations/managed-remote-operations/run_managed_remote_operations.py
```

The script generates a one-use CA and server/agent certificates, writes
owner-protected schema-v3 configs, checks the selected agent installation and
copies its observed portable descriptor into the coordinator's `remote_profiles`.
It then initializes both role roots and starts the
real `daemon-serve` and `agent-serve` commands. It discovers the authenticated
agent with bounded list/detail commands, copies the returned session and config
revision fences into guarded drain/resume requests, and reads each durable
operation through detail and wait.

The coordinator has `local_agent: null`; this journey uses the separate outbound
agent. Its selected Python must already contain Loom. No environment is created
or installed by the check or either service.

The generated credentials are for this localhost journey only. The example
stops both services with their supported interrupt path and fails if either
service or any supervised child remains alive.

The central discover-then-control flow is:

```sh
loom queue daemon-agents --endpoint DAEMON_SOCKET --limit 10
loom queue daemon-agent --endpoint DAEMON_SOCKET machine-B
loom queue daemon-agent-drain \
  --endpoint DAEMON_SOCKET --operation-id maintenance-1 \
  --agent-id machine-B --session-id SESSION --config-revision CONFIG_REVISION \
  --pool default --reason maintenance
loom queue daemon-operation-wait \
  --endpoint DAEMON_SOCKET maintenance-1 --timeout 15
```

## Variants

Use the embedded lifecycle for one machine, or the SLURM journey for an
explicit ready-stage route.


Optional GPU qualification is a maintenance operation. After initializing a GPU
agent with a declared Torch runtime, and before starting its owning service, run
`loom queue agent-check agent.yaml --probe-gpu`.
Use the role files produced or copied for your deployment. A running or retained
agent defers the probe; only a `resources.gpu_compute` PASS proves computation and
cleanup. The existing agent journal retains any uncertain claim across restart.
The configured NVIDIA occupancy check defers an externally busy GPU and reports
failed qualification when availability cannot be established. Other selected
devices can still be tested; a later free observation never clears an uncertain claim.
The CPU journey does not provide physical GPU evidence. See the
[GPU qualification lifecycle](../../../docs/features/queue.md#optional-gpu-compute-qualification).
